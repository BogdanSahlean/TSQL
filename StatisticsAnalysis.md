# StatisticsAnalysis
Query optimization is a mandatory task for some DBAs. Finding queries that generate not only performance problems but could also block the execution of other queries could be the starting point. One of performance indicators used to find out slow queries is logical reads. Logical reads is just the number of data pages read from data cache/buffer pool: more logical reads could mean slow query usually and less is better. To capture info about logical reads, SET STATISTICS IO represents just the simplest option, but, because the output of STATISTICS IO is just text and analysis for many queries could be cumbersome, if not time consuming. The output of STATISTICS in the case of long queries could have a lot of text. Thus, finding queries with problems could be difficult.
Question: is it possible to simplify the analysis of logical reads from STATISTICS output if there are many queries? Consider also that output could contain text generated by TIME ON.
